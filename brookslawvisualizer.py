# TODO Write Readme with purpose and instructions
# TODO Explain all print statements as debug infos
# TODO Write loading bar for higher team size rendering time in terminal?
# TODO Explain why i wrote the graph (e.g. no variables can be used directly in dot notation)
# TODO Make the user chose rendering algorithm (default is circo)
# TODO Why / how did I choose Python and GraphViz/dot? Research, article links, little programming knowledge etc.
# TODO Make a warning if user choses large team size. Its not forecastable how long the rendering will take.
# TODO Team size 100 takes >10 minutes to render? Team Size 30 took 10 seconds; team size 40 took 2 min
