# TODO BLOG Write a ReWrite Tech blog post
# TODO BLOG Explain why i wrote the graph (e.g. no variables can be used directly in dot notation)
# TODO BLOG Why / how did I choose Python and GraphViz/dot? Research, article links, little programming knowledge etc.
# TODO BLOG TIL that i had unused code (total_list function), which i didnt need in the end.
# TODO BLOG Maybe I worked on it one day and by next day I had a different approach
# TODO BLOG Unused code was working, but not called or needed

# TODO Write Readme with purpose and instructions
# TODO Make Readme also with Graph example of different algos? Keep 40 image
# TODO Write down the software requirements (GraphViz, Python3)
# TODO Write loading bar for higher team size rendering time in terminal?
# TODO Make the user chose rendering algorithm (default is circo)
# TODO Ask for input numberâ€¦ warning when bigger than 40. If Yes, than go with it
# TODO Make a warning if user chooses large team size. Its not forecastable how long the rendering will take.
# TODO Team size 100 takes >10 minutes to render? Team Size 30 took 10 seconds; team size 40 took 2 min
# TODO How to test it?
# TODO Add team size + comm lines in image

# Variable declaration block
import re
import subprocess

team_size = 2
iteration = 1
total_list = []
team_list = []

### New idea to seperate the old 'def user_input_team_size():' block
# 1. Get the user input via cmd line as one function: get_user_input
# 2. Feed the user input into a second function: is_user_input_integer
# Stuck: How to reroute from 2nd function to 1st input function, when no integer?

def get_user_input():
    input_value = input("New Please input a team size: ")
    return input_value

def is_user_input_integer(input_value):
    match_val = re.match("[-+]?\\d+$", input_value)

    if match_val is None:
        print("Please enter a valid integer.")
        get_user_input()


    return int(input_value)


# User Input dialogue
# With validation check if input is an integer
# Made it a def block
# TODO Need an exit break to avoid endless loop in unit test
def user_input_team_size():
    IsNotAnInteger = True
    input_value = None
    while IsNotAnInteger:
        # Also refactor line 37 as function.
        input_value = input("Please input a team size: ")
        # Refactor match function. Plus better function name!
        match_val = re.match("[-+]?\\d+$", input_value)
        #
        if match_val is None:
            print("Please enter a valid integer.")
        else:
            IsNotAnInteger = False
    # unit test to check the return value
    return int(input_value)
    #
# IDEA: Input function dedicated writing as a function. Then input that return value to the 'user_input_team_size'
# is_user_input_integer ?

# Feeding the input from def function to variable
# Old variable way: team_size = user_input_team_size()
team_size = is_user_input_integer(get_user_input())

# Create list with elements from team_size, e.g. team_size=4 has list (1, 2, 3, 4)
# Need to set team_size+1 since <list> count start with 0

    for i in range(1, team_size+1):
        team_list.append(int(i))

# Create the graph entries for the GV file with content from team_list
# We iterate and compare the 1st list (team_list) with all entries in 2nd list (team_list_duplicate)
# If it is lesser, we create an entry for the Graphviz GV file
#
# Example:
# team_size=3 has list (1, 2, 3) & team_list_duplicate has list (1, 2, 3)
# 1 >= 1 // skip
# 1 >= 2 // write: 1 -- 2
# 1 >= 3 // write: 1 -- 3
# 2 >= 1 // skip
# 2 >= 2 // skip
# 2 >= 3 // write: 2 -- 3
# 3 >= 1 // skip
# 3 >= 2 // skip
# 3 >= 3 // skip
