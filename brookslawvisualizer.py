# TODO Write loading bar for higher team size rendering time in terminal?
# TODO Explain why i wrote the graph (e.g. no variables can be used directly in dot notation)
# TODO Make the user chose rendering algorithm (default is circo)
# TODO Why / how did I choose Python and GraphViz/dot? Research, article links, little programming knowledge etc.
# TODO Make a warning if user choses large team size. Its not forecastable how long the rendering will take.
