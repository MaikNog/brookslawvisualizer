# Brooks' Law visualizer
This script draws an image with the lines of communication between a given amount of elements.

## History
The history of "Brook's law is described on Wikipedia in detail. The shortform:

Brooks' law is an observation about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later".
It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month.

According to Brooks, under certain conditions, an incremental person when added to a project makes it take more, not less time.

## Overview
I saw a tweet about the "lines of communication" and a nice visual. Researching to find a source, I came across this post: http://leftfoot.com.au/blog/brooks-law-lines-of-communication-calculator-siri-shortcut

I wondered, how a visual with a huge amount of lines of communication would look like, so I began to look for a program, which would draw that with any given input size. I didn't find one.

So I decided to program one myself. 
As a professional tester, coding was never my strong suit and coding tutorials without any practical need never kept me for long.


## This is my learning journey.
Raw thoughts; need to refine them later:
- Starting reading up on the origin, found the formula to calculate the number of relationships ( n*(n-1)/2 ).
- Researched in tools, which draw nodes and edges.
- Read up on Graph Theory
- Decided on Python; seems to be an "easier" programming language to start with.
- Started to setup my coding environment (IntelliJ IDEA), installed python3
- Found GraphViz as a drawing tool
- Needed to create the graph file needed for drawing from scratch; no variable usage in dot language (ËœGraphViz)
- Used debugging ("print" statements), loops, decisions and file operations
- Main python file creates the graph file, which is then drawn by GraphViz.
- After first working prototype experimented with the drawing algorithm, went from DOT to CIRCO.
- Used code TODO to remind me of things.
- Used comments to explain my code; had moments, where I didn't understand, what I wrote a day before.
- Generated a TON of new possible feature ideas.

- Tried to write tests.
- Need to simulate user (commandline) input in tests.
- Running test with "pytest" fails. 
- Running test with "pytest -s" works, but user needs to manually input in every test.
- Experimented with pytest, unittest, monkeypatch.
- Still TOTALLY STUCK after >4 days.
- Reached out in slack channels, got some help, but no solution.
- Current working hypothesis: My environment might be weird.

- Decided to forget tests for now and work to release it.
- Here we are.
